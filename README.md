## Visa

### Do I need a visa?

Incoming non-USA citizens who want to do a postodc in the US, need to get a visa for the specific purpose of their postdoc.

### Which visa should I get?

The visa to get to do do a postdoc is the [J-1 visa](https://j1visa.state.gov/) (but double check with HR).

J-1 visa is for Professors, scholars and teachers as exchange visitors. [Types of US visas](https://www.bankbazaar.com/visa/types-of-us-visa.html).

J-2 visa is for partners of J-1 visa holders.

### How much time in advance should I apply to my visa?

In short: The J-1 visa processing time varies from 5 weeks to over two months not including any travel time.

We recommend to start the process with at least 3 months in advance.

## Travel

Bring your visa a DS-2019 certificate with you, since these will be asked by the broder control at the US airport.

Closest airport is [JFK](https://www.jfkairport.com/).

From JFK the easiest is to take an uber to NYC.

## Housing

If you get MSKCC housing, you will have to pay on your arrival 1 month deposit + your first month of rent.

MSKCC housing is unfurnished, thus what we recommend is for you to arrive in a weekday and early so that stores are open and people in the lab are there too in case you need anything (try not to arrive late nor in Friday or weekend):

1) Get your keys at the indicated place (usually at [Sloan House](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS851US855&tbm=lcl&ei=xbIwXbzbFOua_Qbi0ZOoCQ&q=sloan+house&oq=sloan+house&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l2j0i10k1j0l3j0i10k1l3j0.2215.3574.0.3664.11.11.0.0.0.0.106.858.9j2.11.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.11.857...35i39k1j0i131k1j0i67k1j0i20i263k1.0.LdicIEKvkuk#rlfi=hd:;si:747883077403004333;mv:!1m2!1d40.7653526!2d-73.95662159999999!2m2!1d40.763516200000005!2d-73.9567624!3m12!1m3!1d897.1236976265474!2d-73.956692!3d40.7644344!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i4!2i57!4f13.1))

2) You can pre-order an infltable Mattress form Amazon to be delivered at your new place, so you have it already when you get there. -- You're welcome :)

3) If you come in the winter, also order a sleeping bag or some warm bed stuff. In the winter it can get down to -15 celcius. If you come in the summer, no need to worry about sleeping bag.

Feel free to contact Alejandro [ajs.scientia@gmail.com](ajs.scientia@gmail.com) in case you wanted to leave your suitcases somewhere or had any issues with finding a place to stay before you manage to arrive at your new place.

Housing is selected by HR for you. In principle you can let them know any preferences you may have, and hopefully they will find the most suitable for you.

## Payroll

Talk with Kathy about getting you into payroll, so you know when it starts and you can plan accordingly.

## Bank account

You can apply for a bank account as soon as you arrive. There is are many banks around MSKCC, but perhaps the closest is Chase and you can get a debit card very quickly. Just bring your visa a an passport.

## Social Security Number

Once you are settled in, you will have time to get your SSN and select your health insurence. Just make sure you get them
